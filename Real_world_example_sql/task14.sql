-- Exercise: CTE, Temporary Tables
-- Write a query for the below scenario.

-- The supply chain business manager wants to see which customersâ€™ forecast accuracy has dropped from 2020 to 2021.
-- Provide a complete report with these columns: customer_code, customer_name, market, forecast_accuracy_2020, forecast_accuracy_2021

-- HINT: You can use the query with CTE that was used to generate a forecast accuracy report in the previous chapter first for 2021 and then for 2020. 
-- Then you can use these two tables. 
-- You can temporarily cache these tables in a temporary table or another CTE and then perform the join between the two.--
